## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This time I used 3 media queries for mobile, tablet and desktop:

```CSS
@media(min-width: 40rem) {
}

@media(min-width: 68rem) {
}
```

Not sure if you should use rems for min width though.

### Continued development

Learn more about responsive design and breakdowns for media queries.
